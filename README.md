# LexRanked

Data-driven, source-backed rankings of lawyers and law firms in the United
States — [lexranked.com](https://lexranked.com).

LexRanked is a **headless** platform: WordPress + the `lexranked-core` plugin
is the CMS/API; a Next.js app is the only public frontend. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Principles

accuracy > quantity · verified data > generated assumptions · useful pages >
many pages · transparent methodology > black-box rankings · reproducible
rankings > subjective rankings. **Payment never changes an organic ranking.**

## Repository

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `frontend/` | Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript) public site |
| `wordpress/plugins/lexranked-core/` | All LexRanked business logic + REST API (`/wp-json/lexranked/v1/`) |
| `workers/research/` | TypeScript research worker (Phase 5); `workers/*` others in later phases |
| `database/` | Reference schema and migrations |
| `docs/` | Architecture, data model, methodology, API, research, content, deployment |
| `scripts/check.sh` | Runs every CI check locally |

## Requirements

Node.js 22 (`.nvmrc`), PHP ≥ 8.2 + Composer 2, Docker (for local WordPress).

## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.example .env                       # local docker credentials
cp .env.example frontend/.env.local        # frontend config (server-only vars stay server-side)

# WordPress + MariaDB at http://localhost:8080 (plugin is bind-mounted)
docker compose up -d
docker compose run --rm wpcli wp core install --url=http://localhost:8080 --title=LexRanked \
  --admin_user=admin --admin_password=admin --admin_email=admin@example.com --skip-email
docker compose run --rm wpcli wp rewrite structure '/%postname%/'
docker compose run --rm wpcli wp plugin activate lexranked-core
docker compose run --rm wpcli wp lexranked seed-demo      # clearly-labelled mock data
curl http://localhost:8080/wp-json/lexranked/v1/lawyers

# Frontend at http://localhost:3000 (set WORDPRESS_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/wp-json
# in frontend/.env.local), then open http://localhost:3000/status/
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# Plugin tooling
cd wordpress/plugins/lexranked-core && composer install && composer lint && composer test

# Research worker (see docs/research.md): create a worker user + a job, then run it
docker compose run --rm wpcli wp user create research-worker research@example.com --role=lexranked_worker
docker compose run --rm wpcli wp user application-password create research-worker local --porcelain
docker compose run --rm wpcli wp lexranked research-job candidate_discovery --params='{"dataset":"fictional-demo"}'
cd workers/research && npm ci && npm run build && \
  LEXRANKED_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/wp-json/lexranked/v1 LEXRANKED_WORKER_USER=research-worker \
  LEXRANKED_WORKER_APP_PASSWORD='…' LEXRANKED_DATA_DIR=fixtures/datasets node dist/cli.js --once
```

## Checks

```bash
scripts/check.sh                 # lint, typecheck, tests, build — same as CI
scripts/wp-integration-test.sh   # real WordPress in Docker + API + research worker (crash/resume) assertions
scripts/wp-integration-test.sh --frontend   # …plus Next.js built against it (end-to-end)
scripts/build-plugin-zip.sh      # installable plugin ZIP → dist/
```

## Roadmap

1. ✅ Repository and architecture
2. ✅ WordPress core: entities, REST API, admin UI, validation (+ frontend API client and `/status/`)
3. ✅ Frontend: public pages, design system, SEO/GEO content, structured data, sitemap
4. ✅ **Ranking engine**: ScoreCalculator, RankingEngine, ScoreVersion, snapshots, history, breakdowns
5. ✅ **Research engine**: leased/resumable jobs with retries, candidates + deterministic matching, source-backed claims, rule-based verification, editorial review, TypeScript worker
6. ✅ **AI assistance**: quote-checked extraction & classification, advisory match review, ranking content drafts with deterministic + AI QA — strict schemas, never published automatically
7. ✅ **Content engine**: guides at `/articles/`, editorial text on hub pages and profiles, AI drafts (ranking, hub, profile, article) with QA — drafts only
8. ✅ **Production hardening**: signed instant revalidation, response cache, CSP/HSTS, health monitoring, backups, automated SEO/structured-data audit
9. ✅ **Commercial features**: profile claims with email confirmation and editor identity checks, premium profiles, featured profiles, sponsored listings — labelled, eligibility-checked, and provably unable to change a score or position

### Knowledge base (docs/knowledge-base.md)

A. ✅ **Entity model**: stable entity IDs for lawyers, firms, locations and practice areas; renames keep identity and redirect old URLs
B. ✅ **Evidence layers**: attribute registry, entity-keyed claims with raw + normalised values, fact layer with per-fact source and freshness, source objects, identifier-based entity resolution, provenance
C. ✅ **Data Quality Score**: separate, published documentation score (completeness, freshness, source quality, verification coverage, consistency), shown on profiles, never a ranking input
D. ✅ **Ranking explanations + methodology v1.1**: scores from evidence-backed facts; "Why #N?" on every entry; position changes explained from snapshot differences
E. ✅ **Comparison engine**: `/compare/?lawyer=…&lawyer=…` (noindex) compares 2–4 lawyers or firms from stored facts, each cell with its source and check date; differences stated, never a verdict; linked from rankings and profiles
F. ✅ **Contextual rankings**: "best for" rankings by case type, client type or language, e.g. `/rankings/florida/miami/personal-injury/car-accidents/`. Entities qualify only through sourced facts, and a page exists only above a verified-data threshold. The context never changes a score, and key card attributes follow the context
G. ✅ **Page eligibility engine**: one explained, published decision per page (exists / indexed) from entities, verified entities, real data, evidence coverage and context; it drives rendering, robots and the sitemap, never keywords
H. ✅ **AI-readable pages**: answer-first summaries built from facts, a per-fact "Sources & verification" panel, ranking sources and data-generated related questions, a live methodology page and schema.org that mirrors visible data
I. ✅ **Market statistics and coverage**: counts, verified counts, average rating, median reviews and the most common practice area, computed by the backend with sample sizes (withheld below 3) and shown on hubs and rankings
J. ✅ **AI interpretation layer**: the model only summarizes, explains, compares, classifies and writes from backend-computed facts (with verified / sourced / computed status). It never invents, computes a number or decides a position; QA enforces this, and output stays a draft ([docs/ai-interpretation.md](docs/ai-interpretation.md))
K. ✅ **Autonomous research** (opt-in): workers create research jobs, and a completed job publishes only profiles that pass fixed checks (licence and bar status verified by an official source, no conflicts, nothing missing) with their records and sources, and creates rankings above the threshold; doubtful results stay drafts with the reason ([docs/research.md](docs/research.md#autonomous-research))

## Security

Never commit secrets. Server-only variables (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix) are
read only in modules guarded by `server-only`. Report issues privately to the
maintainers.
