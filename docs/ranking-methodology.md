# Ranking methodology — LexRank

> Status: **implemented (Phase 4)**. Engine: `wordpress/plugins/lexranked-core/src/Ranking/`.

## Guarantees

- **Deterministic and reproducible.** `ScoreCalculator` is a pure function
  of (inputs, context, version). There is no clock, randomness, database or
  LLM inside it. Every calculation stores its exact inputs in a snapshot, and
  `wp lexranked verify-snapshots` recomputes stored runs and fails if any
  score differs.
- **No LLM decides a position.** Order: score DESC → number of sourced facts
  DESC → entity ID ASC.
- **Payment never changes the organic score.** `EntityInput` has no
  commercial field. A unit test asserts that no payment-related property
  exists and that extra stored keys are ignored.
- **Explainable.** Each component stores its points, its maximum, a
  plain-English explanation and the inputs that were missing. The profile
  breakdown is built only from these stored values.
- **Unknown is never guessed.** A missing input scores 0 for its component
  and is listed as missing.

## Versions

A version (`ScoreVersion`) is an immutable, named set of weights (which must
sum to 100) and parameters:
- Built-in versions live in code (`ScoreVersions::builtin()`), so any change
  is reviewed and versioned in git.
- A built-in id can never be redefined.
- Changing weights or the input source means adding a new version (v1.1 changed the input source; v1.2 stopped scoring reviews).
- The active version is selected in **LexRanked › Settings**.
- A ranking may pin its own version.

## v1.2 (active): client reviews not scored

Google and other platforms do not allow their ratings to be stored, and
LexRanked's own client reviews (email-confirmed, approved by an editor) are
only starting, so v1.2 leaves reviews out of the score until enough exist to
compare lawyers fairly. Reviews are still collected and shown on profiles.

| Component | v1.1 | v1.2 |
|---|---|---|
| Reputation | 30 (awards ½, review volume ½) | 20 (awards only, up to 5) |
| Review strength | 20 | 0 (not a component) |
| Experience | 15 | 30 |
| Practice-area relevance | 15 | 20 |
| Professional credentials | 10 | 15 |
| Local relevance | 5 | 5 |
| Data quality | 5 | 10 (rating and review count leave the key-fact check) |

- Defined in `ScoreVersions::builtin()` with the parameter `reviews_scored = 0`;
  components weighted 0 are left out of the breakdown.
- Sites still on v1.1 move to v1.2 once, on the schema v10 upgrade; a version
  chosen deliberately in Settings stays.
- Earlier snapshots keep the version that produced them and still reproduce.
- Approved LexRanked reviews are recorded as `rating`/`review_count` evidence
  (source type `lexranked_reviews`, tier 5), ready for a later version that
  scores them.

## v1.1: scores from evidence

v1.1 uses exactly the v1.0 weights and formulas below. The only change is
**where the inputs come from**: the evidence-backed fact layer
(SOURCES → CLAIMS → FACTS → NORMALISED ATTRIBUTES → COMPONENTS → SCORE,
docs/knowledge-base.md).

- Rating, review count, years of experience, bar status, website, awards and education are read from `lr_facts`, not from profile fields.
- A value filled in on a profile **without a source counts as missing**.
- A fact whose equally authoritative sources disagree (`conflict`) also counts as missing until an editor resolves it.
- Membership in a ranking (location and practice areas) comes from the editorial taxonomy, as before.
- Before scoring, the engine flushes pending fact rebuilds, so evidence stored earlier in the same request counts.
- A change in evidence schedules a recalculation.
- Snapshots record the version that produced them: v1.0 runs stay v1.0, and `verify-snapshots` reproduces both.
- `ScoreVersion::$input` is `profile` (v1.0) or `facts` (v1.1). `GET /score-versions` publishes it.

## Explanations (Etap D)

Every ranking entry carries two explanations, computed from stored snapshots by `RankingExplainer`. There is no AI and no free text: fixed templates are filled with numbers.

**`why`: why the entry ranks where it does**
- Its **strongest** components: the largest edge over the ranking's average, measured relative to the component's maximum.
- The components that **hold it back** (below 75 % of their maximum; never the same as a strength).
- What separates it from the entry **above**: the points gap and the components with the largest differences.
- **Missing** inputs, which score 0 and are never estimated.

**`change`: what changed since the previous run**
- The methodology version, if it changed.
- Its own component deltas.
- Its own input changes, e.g. "review count 154 → 900".
- **Competitors** that moved past it (with their score change), dropped below it, joined above it, or left the ranking.

The frontend shows both in a "Why #N?" disclosure on every entry.

## v1.0

| Component | Weight | Factor (0–1) |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Reputation | 30 | 0.5 × min(awards, 5)/5 + 0.5 × ln(1 + reviews)/ln(1 + 500) |
| Review strength | 20 | Bayesian rating (below), mapped linearly from 3.0 → 0 to 5.0 → 1 |
| Experience | 15 | min(years, 25)/25 |
| Practice-area relevance | 15 | 0 if the ranked practice area is not listed; otherwise 0.5 + 0.5 / (number of practice areas) |
| Professional credentials | 10 | Lawyers: active bar status 0.5 + verified license 0.25 + education on record 0.25. Firms: verified business 0.5 + verified website 0.25 + ≥ 1 profiled lawyer 0.25 |
| Local relevance | 5 | Based in the ranked city (or ranked state for state rankings) 1; elsewhere in the same state 0.5; otherwise 0 |
| Data quality | 5 | 0.4 × key facts present/7 + 0.3 × key facts backed by evidence/7 + 0.3 × (verified 1, pending 0.5, else 0) |

Key facts: rating, review count, years of experience, bar status, website,
practice areas and location.

Points = factor × weight, rounded to 2 decimals. The total is the sum of the
points, so the breakdown always adds up to the score exactly.

### Review strength (isolated module)

`BayesianReviewScorer` implements the `ReviewScorer` interface and can be
replaced without touching the rest of the engine:

```
adjusted = (C × m + n × r) / (C + n)        v1.0: m = 4.0, C = 25
```

Example: 5.0 stars from 3 reviews → 4.11 adjusted, while 4.8 from 400
reviews → 4.75. No review text is copied and no quotations are invented.

## Context

Scores depend on context:
- **Rankings:** the ranking's practice area and location.
- **Entity-level scores** (shown on profiles and used for list sorting): the
  entity's own primary practice area and city.

Law firms use the longest-practising profiled lawyer for experience.

### Contextual rankings ("best for", Etap F)

A contextual ranking (car accidents, Spanish-speaking, for businesses)
**selects** who is ranked; it never changes a score.

- **Who is included.** An entity is included only when a stored fact confirms the context:
  - `case_types` for a case type (a sub-area of the practice area in the taxonomy);
  - `languages` for a language;
  - `client_types` for a client type.

  The fact must have a source and must not be in conflict. Nothing is inferred from names or text.
- **Scores.** Included entities keep exactly the score they have in the broader ranking (same methodology version, same practice-area context).
- **Case types are not practice areas.** A case type such as "car accidents" is kept in its own fact, so listing it never dilutes practice-area relevance (0.5 + 0.5 / n counts practice areas only).
- **The page exists only when:**
  - at least `min_entities` (default 5) qualify;
  - at least `min_verified` (default 3) qualify by a **verified** fact;
  - fewer entities qualify than in the broader ranking (otherwise the page would repeat it).

  Below that threshold the API marks the ranking thin: no entries, a 404, and no sitemap entry. The counts and the reasons are published.
- **Snapshots** store the qualifier and each entry's qualifying evidence.

## Runs and snapshots

`RankingRunner` recalculates:
- daily (WP-cron `lexranked_recalculate`);
- about 60 seconds after edits to lawyers, firms, rankings or verification
  records;
- on demand, from the **Recalculate now** button or with
  `wp lexranked recalculate`.

Each run writes rows to `{prefix}lr_ranking_snapshots` (`run_id`,
`ranking_id` — 0 for entity-level scores — `entity_id`, `position`, `score`,
`score_version`, `context`, `components`, `inputs`, `calculated_at`). Runs
are inserted in a transaction. Public rankings are served from the latest
run, with **movement** measured against the previous run. The history is
available at `GET /rankings/{id}/history`.
