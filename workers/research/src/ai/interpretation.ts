/**
 * AI Interpretation Layer (Etap J).
 *
 * LexRanked's data flows one way: data → evidence → ranking → page → AI text.
 * The model sits at the very end and only INTERPRETS what the backend has
 * already established: it may summarize, explain, compare, classify and
 * write — from the numbered facts it is given. It may not invent facts,
 * research from memory, compute new numbers or decide, change or judge a
 * position. Everything it writes is a draft that deterministic QA checks and
 * an editor approves.
